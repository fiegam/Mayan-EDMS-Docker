# Mayan-EDMS-Docker
The configuration and extension of Mayan EDMS

This is only a fork of the Mayan EDMS repository (https://github.com/mayan-edms/Mayan-EDMS). Actually only the docker configuration part.

The repository extend the original one with some utilities like backup/restore scripts, as well as the my own instance configuration
